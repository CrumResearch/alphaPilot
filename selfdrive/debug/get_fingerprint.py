# simple script to get a vehicle fingerprint.

# Instructions:
# - connect to a Panda
# - run selfdrive/boardd/boardd
# - launching this script
# - turn on the car in STOCK MODE (set giraffe switches properly).
#   Note: it's very important that the car is in stock mode, in order to collect a complete fingerprint
# - since some messages are published at low frequency, keep this script running for at least 30s,
#   until all messages are received at least once

import selfdrive.messaging as messaging

  for c in lc.can:
    # read also msgs sent by EON on CAN bus 0x80 and filter out the
    # addr with more than 11 bits
    if c.src%0x80 == 0 and c.address < 0x800:
      msgs[c.address] = len(c.dat)

  fingerprint = ', '.join("%d: %d" % v for v in sorted(msgs.items()))
